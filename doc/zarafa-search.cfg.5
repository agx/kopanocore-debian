.SH "NAME"
zarafa-search.cfg \- The Zarafa Search configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsearch\&.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
search\&.cfg
is a configuration file for the Zarafa Search Service\&.
search\&.cfg
contains instructions for the software to set up the connection, indexing and logging systems\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based\&. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive\&. A line beginning with `#\*(Aq is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Zarafa\&. Parameter names are case sensitive\&. Lines beginning with `!\*(Aq are directives\&.
.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR

Default:
\fIfile:///var/run/zarafa\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this user, dropping root privileges\&. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation\&. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_group\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this group, dropping root privileges\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the group after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpid_file\fR
.RS 4
Write the process ID number to this file\&. This is used by the init\&.d script to correctly stop/restart the service\&.
.sp

.sp
Default:
\fI/\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlimit_results\fR
.RS 4
Limit the number of results returned to the server\&. If set to a nonzero value, only the N most relevant results will be returned to the server\&. This in turn limits the number of results that the user will see\&. If the limit is set to 0, all results will be returned\&.

.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE INDEX OPTIMIZE SCHEDULE PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBoptimize_start\fR
.RS 4
Start the optimization routine at this hour every day\&. The routine optimizes every index, removing old data and recompressing it, making it faster and smaller\&. Notation is in 24h format, default starts at 2 am\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI2\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBoptimize_stop\fR
.RS 4
Stop the optimization routine at this hour when not all files were processed\&. The routine will continue were left off the next day it\*(Aqs started\&. The current file being processed will be finished, so the time will be passed\&. Notation is in 24h format, default stops at 5 am\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI5\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBoptimize_age\fR

\fI7\fR
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE ATTACHMENT SEARCH SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBindex_attachments\fR
.RS 4
Enable indexing of attachments\&. When attachments are being indexed, searching for keywords in the body of a message will automatically cause the attachment to be searched as well\&.
.sp
This will slow down the indexing process, require more system memory and increases index file size\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_max_size\fR
.RS 4
Maxiumum file size for attachments to be indexed\&. Any attachment larger then this amount will not be indexed\&. This value may contain a k, m or g multiplier\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI5M\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_parser\fR
.RS 4
For indexing attachment each file must be converted into plain\-text by a parser\&. For this purpose the
\fIattachments_parser\fR
script has been installed which can be configured to parse specific mime\-types\&.
.sp
It is highly advisable to check the
\fIattachments_parser\&.db\fR
file to add or remove parser command for specific mime\-types and/or file\-extensions\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/searchscripts/attachments_parser\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_parser_max_memory\fR
.RS 4
Limit the maximum amount of memory (in bytes) the parser may use for converting the attachment into plain\-text\&. If this limit is exceeded the parser will be killed and the attachment will not be completely converted\&. If the value is set to
\fI0\fR
the limit is considered as infinite\&.
.sp
The attachment parser depends on external tools to convert attachments to plain\-text, by limiting the amount of resources the parser is allowed to use problems can be prevented when the selected external tool misbehaves with certain attachments\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI0\fR
bytes
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_parser_max_cputime\fR
.RS 4
Limit the maximum cpu time (in seconds) the parser may use for converting the attachment into plain\-text\&. If this limit is exceeded the parser will be killed and the attachment will not be completely converted\&. If the value is set to
\fI0\fR
the limit is considered as infinite\&.
.sp

.sp
Default:
\fI0\fR
seconds
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_mime_filter\fR
.RS 4
Some attachments are not intresting to run through the parser\&. With this option you can filter out attachment which have a specific mimetype\&. Only the first part of the mimetype should be given here\&. Good examples of a mimetype to filter is \*(Aqimage\*(Aq, \*(Aqaudio\*(Aq and \*(Aqvideo\*(Aq\&. This field is space separated\&.
.sp
Default:
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_extension_filter\fR
.RS 4
As the mime filter above, but works on the attachment extension\&. This is only tested if the mimetype of an attachment was unknown\&. Good examples of an extension to filter is \*(Aqgif\*(Aq, \*(Aqjpeg\*(Aq, \*(Aqjpg\*(Aq and \*(Aqpng\*(Aq\&. This field is space separated\&.
.sp
Default:
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_max_clauses\fR
.RS 4
This is the maximum number of clauses that can be present in a Lucene search query, after expansion\&. You can raise this limit if you are experiencing a Too Many Clauses error during searches\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI50000\fR
clauses
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE INDEX FILTERS SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBindex_exclude_properties\fR
.RS 4
Some properties are ignored because they contain unrelated information for users to find their messages on\&. A default set of ignored property ids is set here, but can be expanded\&. Only the id part of a property is needed, and must be string typed properties\&. The field is space separated\&.
.sp
Default: 007D 0064 0C1E 0075 678E 678F
.RE
.PP
\fBterm_cache_size\fR
.RS 4
The size in bytes of the term cache used when writing terms to the index\&. A larger term cache will increase indexing speed when indexing large number of documents in a single store\&. This will barely affect incremental updates after the initial indexing has finished\&. This value may contain a k, m or g multiplier\&.
