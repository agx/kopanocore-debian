.SH "NAME"
zarafa-search.cfg \- The Zarafa Search configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsearch\&.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
search\&.cfg
is a configuration file for the Zarafa Search Service\&.
search\&.cfg
contains instructions for the software to set up the connection, indexing and logging systems\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based\&. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive\&. A line beginning with `#\*(Aq is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Zarafa\&. Parameter names are case sensitive\&. Lines beginning with `!\*(Aq are directives\&.
.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR
.RS 4
Include and process
\fIargument\fR

.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE SERVICE SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBindex_path\fR
.RS 4
Directory under which all index files will be placed\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/lib/zarafa/index/\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this user, dropping root privileges\&. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation\&. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_group\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this group, dropping root privileges\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the group after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpid_file\fR
.RS 4
Write the process ID number to this file\&. This is used by the init\&.d script to correctly stop/restart the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/run/zarafa\-search\&.pid\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrunning_path\fR
.RS 4
Change directory to this path when running in daemonize mode\&. When using the \-F switch to run in the foreground the directory will not be changed\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlimit_results\fR
.RS 4
Limit the number of results returned to the server\&. If set to a nonzero value, only the N most relevant results will be returned to the server\&. This in turn limits the number of results that the user will see\&. If the limit is set to 0, all results will be returned\&.
.sp
Default:\fI0\fR
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE SERVER SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBserver_socket\fR

.sp
Default:
\fIfile:///var/run/zarafa\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_key_file\fR
.RS 4
The file containing the private key and certificate\&. Please read the SSL section in the
\fBzarafa-server\fR(8)
manual on how to create this file\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/ssl/search\&.pem\fR
.RE
.PP

.sp
No default set\&.
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE LISTEN SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBserver_bind_name\fR
.RS 4
Connection path to which other processes can connect with the zarafa\-search for performing search queries\&.
.sp
Use
\fIhttp://0\&.0\&.0\&.0:port\fR
to listen as an HTTP service on all network interfaces on the given
\fIport\fR
number\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIfile:///var/run/zarafa\-search\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_private_key_file\fR
.RS 4
zarafa\-search will use this file as private key for SSL TLS\&. This file can be created with:
\fBopenssl genrsa \-out /etc/zarafa/search/privkey\&.pem 2048\fR\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/search/privkey\&.pem\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_certificate_file\fR
.RS 4
zarafa\-search will use this file as certificate for SSL TLS\&. A self\-signed certificate can be created with:
\fBopenssl req \-new \-x509 \-key /etc/zarafa/search/privkey\&.pem \-out /etc/zarafa/search/cert\&.pem \-days 1095\fR\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/search/cert\&.pem\fR
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE LOG SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBlog_method\fR
.RS 4
The method which should be used for logging\&. Valid values are:
.PP
\fIsyslog\fR
.RS 4
Use the Linux system log\&. All messages will be written to the mail facility\&. See also
\fBsyslog.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Log to a file\&. The filename will be specified in
\fBlog_file\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
Default:
\fIfile\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_level\fR
.RS 4
The level of output for logging in the range from 0 to 5\&. 0 means no logging, 5 means full logging\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI2\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_file\fR
.RS 4
When logging to a file, specify the filename in this parameter\&. Use
\fI\-\fR
(minus sign) for stderr output\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/log/zarafa/search\&.log\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_timestamp\fR
.RS 4
Specify whether to prefix each log line with a timestamp in \*(Aqfile\*(Aq logging mode\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI1\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_buffer_size\fR
.RS 4
Buffer logging in what sized blocks\&. Bigger buffers is better for the performance but it gives lag when running e\&.g\&. multitail or \*(Aqtail \-f\*(Aq on the log\-file\&. If you want to directly see what is happing, set this to e\&.g\&. 1\&. So when debugging: make it a small value, else set it to 4096 or more\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI4096\fR
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE ADVANCED SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBterm_cache_size\fR
.RS 4
The size in bytes of the term cache used when writing terms to the index\&. A larger term cache will increase indexing speed when indexing large number of documents in a single store\&. This will barely affect incremental updates after the initial indexing has finished\&. This value may contain a k, m or g multiplier\&.
.sp
Default: 64M
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_exclude_properties\fR
.RS 4
Some properties are ignored because they contain unrelated information for users to find their messages on\&. A default set of ignored property ids is set here, but can be expanded\&. Only the id part of a property is needed, and must be string typed properties\&. The field is space separated\&.
.sp
Default: 007D 0064 0C1E 0075 678E 678F
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_processes\fR
.RS 4
Number of indexing processes used during initial indexing\&. Setting this to a higher value can greatly speed up initial indexing, especially when attachments are indexed\&.
.sp
Default: 1
.RE
.PP
\fBsearch_engine\fR
.RS 4
Backend search engine (currently only xapian is supported)\&.
.sp
Default: xapian
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE ATTACHMENT SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBindex_attachments\fR
.RS 4
Enable indexing of attachments\&. When attachments are being indexed, searching for keywords in the body of a message will automatically cause the attachment to be searched as well\&.
.sp
This will slow down the indexing process, require more system memory and increases index file size\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_max_size\fR
.RS 4
Maxiumum file size for attachments to be indexed\&. Any attachment larger then this amount will not be indexed\&. This value may contain a k, m or g multiplier\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI5M\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_mime_filter\fR
.RS 4
Some attachments are not intresting to run through the parser\&. With this option you can filter out attachment which have a specific mimetype\&. Only the first part of the mimetype should be given here\&. Good examples of a mimetype to filter is \*(Aqimage\*(Aq, \*(Aqaudio\*(Aq and \*(Aqvideo\*(Aq\&. This field is space separated\&.
.sp
Default:
.RE
.PP
\fBindex_attachment_extension_filter\fR
.RS 4
As the mime filter above, but works on the attachment extension\&. This is only tested if the mimetype of an attachment was unknown\&. Good examples of an extension to filter is \*(Aqgif\*(Aq, \*(Aqjpeg\*(Aq, \*(Aqjpg\*(Aq and \*(Aqpng\*(Aq\&. This field is space separated\&.
